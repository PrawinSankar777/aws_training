# AWS Event-driven, Serverless Architectures with AWS Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, and API Gateway

In this repo, we will explore modern application development using an event-driven, serverless architecture on AWS. To demonstrate this architecture, we will integrate several fully-managed services, all part of the AWS Serverless Computing platform. Serverless AWS offerings include Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, S3, and DynamoDB. The end result will be an application composed of small, easily deployable, loosely coupled serverless components.
